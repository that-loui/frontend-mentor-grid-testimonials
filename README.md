## My process

### process

Built the html markup following the design files, started with the base structure of the project, added my css file and added all necessary elements to the html file. When writing the markup made use of shared class names to ease styling.

Started the css by importing the font from google, the general styles for all elements and for the body element. Then went on to style the container used to house all the cards. Made use of css Grid to develop that structure, created 4 grid columns to 2 rows, used **grid-template** to style each individual grid element which then brought out the grid structure that looked similar to the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
